The extension I added was the portals that can teleport the player from one
portal to another random portal. The portals take 5 seconds to recharge and 
the unavailability of the portals is visually represented when the images 
turn from blue to dark grey.

Also, for testing, when running 'gradle test jacocotestreport', please let
it run for at least 15-20 seconds because I added very long delays.

Have fun playing!
